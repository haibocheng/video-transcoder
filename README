Update to my screencast from March 2007.  Removes ActiveMQ in favor of a simplified SPAWN.  If you plan on having a bunch of users, you will probably want to replace spawn with ap4r.

The spawn plugin in this project is monkeypatched to work with passenger, but I think the patch is going to be accepted, until then if you are pulling spawn for your project that uses passenger, pull my copy.  git://github.com/tkadom/spawn.git

FFMPEG:
you need to install ffmpeg manually.  There are plenty of sites that help you do this on your platform.  On OSX. the easiest is to use port.  

sudo port install ffmpeg +lame +libogg +vorbis +faac +faad +xvid +x264 +a52 (if your on osx)
sudo gem install flvtool2

flvtool seems to get an error when placed into environment.rb

sudo rake gems:install

let me know if you run into any issues.  Tested to work with passenger and mongrel.  I think there is a known issue with spawn and thin, but why would you still use thin?
